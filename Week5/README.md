Please run the ```solver_aki.py```.
# **WEEK5 HOMEWORK**
Travelling Salesman Problem Challenges

### How to use
To run this Python3 file, first we should set the directory.
```
$ cd ../STEP/Week5
```
To run the program, the command should be in this format:
```
$ python3 solver_aki.py input_0.csv output_0.csv
```

```0``` can be changed into a number in ```0~6```

Still running on Challenge 4 to 6, so I will update the output{4~6}.csv later!
